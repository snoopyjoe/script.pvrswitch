Toggle Kodi PVR Manager

Can manually toggle the PVR manager or addon will auto toggle when TV Channels or TV Guide window is active.
Service only runs until the TV Channels or TV Guide window is active, then toggles PVR Manager.

Useful for when PVR addon loads before EPG data is available. Often leaving blank PVR guides.
